# General Lottery Dapp

This project is a boilerplate for a decentralized lottery application. It is organized into four main parts:

- **contracts/** – Solidity smart contracts.
- **backend/** – Node.js server that interacts with the blockchain.
- **frontend/** – Client-side code for interacting with the lottery contract.
- **scripts/** – Automation and deployment scripts.

## Features

- Smart contract for managing a lottery draw (placeholder in `contracts/Lottery.sol`).
- Express backend that can be expanded to expose API endpoints.
- Simple frontend scaffold ready for integration with a JS framework.
- Deployment and automation scripts in the `scripts` directory.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open `frontend/index.html` in a browser to view the basic UI.

## Deployment

Deployment scripts will live inside `scripts/`. To deploy the smart contract (when implemented), run:

```bash
node scripts/deploy.js
```

Modify `scripts/deploy.js` with the necessary logic for your deployment tooling (e.g., Hardhat or Truffle).
