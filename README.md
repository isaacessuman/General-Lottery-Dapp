# General-Lottery-Dapp

This repository contains the skeleton of a lottery dApp. Tests are located under the `contracts/test` and `backend/test` directories.

## Running Tests

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Run Hardhat (smart contract) tests:
   ```
   npx hardhat test
   ```
3. Run backend tests:
   ```
   npm test
   ```

These commands assume you have Node.js and Hardhat installed locally.
